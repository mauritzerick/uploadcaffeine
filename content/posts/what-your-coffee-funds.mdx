Transparency matters. Here's exactly where the caffeine goes each month.

## The Breakdown

Every dollar you contribute helps cover:

### 🖥️ Hosting & Infrastructure ($15-30/month)

- **Vercel Pro** - Fast, global CDN
- **Database hosting** - PostgreSQL/SQLite
- **Domain registration** - .au domain
- **Email service** - Transactional emails

### 🎨 Design & Assets ($20-50/month)

- **Figma Pro** - Design tool subscription
- **Font licenses** - Professional typography
- **Icon packs** - High-quality iconography
- **Stock assets** - Occasional illustrations

### 🧪 Development Tools ($30-60/month)

- **GitHub Pro** - Private repos and advanced features
- **Testing devices** - Browser/device testing services
- **API services** - Third-party integrations
- **Development software** - IDEs, debugging tools

### ☕ Actual Coffee ($40-80/month)

- **Local café** - Where most code happens
- **Home espresso** - Late-night coding sessions
- **Emergency energy drinks** - We don't talk about this

### 📚 Learning & Growth ($20-40/month)

- **Courses** - Keeping skills sharp
- **Books** - Technical and design learning
- **Conference tickets** - Networking and inspiration
- **Subscriptions** - Dev newsletters and resources

## Monthly Target: $150-200

This covers all basics and allows for:
- Continuous improvement
- New experiments
- Better tools
- More coffee ☕

## Current Status

Check the [homepage](https://uploadcaffeine.com) for the live monthly progress bar!

## What Doesn't Get Funded

To be completely transparent, these are NOT covered by donations:

- My rent or living expenses
- Non-dev personal spending
- Marketing or ads
- Salaries (it's just me!)

## Why Not Patreon/Ko-fi?

I built my own platform because:

1. **Full Control** - My design, my rules
2. **Learning Experience** - Built with Next.js, Stripe, Prisma
3. **No Platform Fees** - More money goes to actual costs
4. **Brand Consistency** - Cyberpunk theme throughout
5. **Open Source Potential** - Might open-source later

## Quarterly Reports

Every 3 months, I'll post an update showing:
- Total support received
- Exact spending breakdown
- New features shipped
- Upcoming plans

## What Happens with Excess?

If monthly support exceeds costs:

- 🎯 **Save for larger purchases** (new laptop, licenses)
- 🚀 **Invest in bigger projects**
- 💝 **Support other indie creators**
- 🎁 **Surprise community giveaways**

## The Philosophy

I believe in:

- **Transparency** - You deserve to know where money goes
- **Fair pricing** - No guilt-trip tiers
- **No rewards** - Support should be optional, not transactional
- **Community** - Building together, not extracting value

## Tax & Legal

For Australian tax purposes:

- All income is declared
- GST registered if threshold met
- Proper invoicing maintained
- Compliant with ATO regulations

Your contribution may not be tax-deductible (I'm not a registered charity), but it directly supports independent creation.

## The Real Value

Beyond the money, your support:

- **Validates the work** - Someone cares!
- **Motivates continuation** - Keeps projects alive
- **Builds community** - Connects like-minded people
- **Enables experimentation** - Try new, weird ideas
