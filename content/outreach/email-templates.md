Subject: Launched a new indie dev support platform (with neon vibes) 🇦🇺

Hi [Community Name],

I'm Mauritz, an indie developer based in Sydney, and I just launched something I think you'll find interesting.

uploadcaffeine.com is a cyberpunk-themed donation platform built specifically for Australian indie developers. Think "buy me a coffee" but with personality, full technical control, and zero platform fees.

Features include:
- Stripe integration for secure payments
- MDX-powered blog
- Free developer tools (gradient maker, SFX generator, quote tool)
- Interactive easter eggs
- Full SEO optimization

I built it as both a practical tool and a learning project using Next.js 14, TypeScript, and modern web technologies.

Would love to hear your thoughts! Feel free to check it out, provide feedback, or share it with developers who might find it useful.
