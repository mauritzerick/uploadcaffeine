Indie developers power the internet's weird, fun corners. If my neon experiments made you smile, a simple coffee keeps them going.

## Quick Ways to Support

- **Quick tip**: hit the **Upload Caffeine** button on the homepage.
- **Prefer monthly?** Toggle **Make it monthly** for recurring support.
- **Want transparency?** Check the **Mission** page to see exactly where your support goes.

## Why Support Indie Devs?

Independent developers in Australia face unique challenges:

- Higher costs of living compared to many tech hubs
- Fewer local funding opportunities
- Time zone differences making collaboration harder
- But we're building cool stuff anyway! 🚀

## What Your Coffee Buys

Every contribution, no matter how small, helps me:

- Keep the servers running
- Afford design tools and licenses
- Buy test devices for cross-platform compatibility
- Most importantly: stay caffeinated and motivated

## The Cyberpunk Approach

Unlike traditional donation platforms, I built this with personality. Neon glows, glitch effects, and playful interactions make supporting creators fun, not just transactional.

## Join the Community

When you support an indie dev, you're not just sending money—you're joining a community of people who believe in independent creation and experimental projects.

**Thank you for considering support!** 🙏☕
