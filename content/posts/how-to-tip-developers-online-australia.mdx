Tipping online should be easy. Our neon tip jar supports one-time or monthly support, and your card is processed by Stripe.

## Why Tip Developers?

Developers, especially indie ones, often:
- Maintain open-source projects for free
- Create tools and libraries you use daily
- Share knowledge through blogs and tutorials
- Build experimental projects that push boundaries

A small tip goes a long way in showing appreciation.

## Methods to Tip Developers

### 1. One-Time Donations

Perfect for:
- Saying thanks for a specific project
- Acknowledging a helpful blog post
- Supporting a cool experiment you discovered

### 2. Monthly Support

Best for:
- Projects you use regularly
- Developers whose work consistently helps you
- Long-term sustainability

### 3. Commissioned Work

For larger support:
- Hire devs for freelance work
- Commission custom features
- Sponsor specific development

## The Australian Context

Tipping culture isn't as common in Australia as in some countries, but digital tipping is growing. It's becoming normal to support:

- Content creators
- Open-source maintainers
- Indie game developers
- Tutorial creators

## How This Site Works

1. **No Account Required** - Just pay and go
2. **Secure Processing** - Stripe handles everything
3. **Transparent Use** - See exactly where funds go
4. **Cancel Anytime** - Monthly support? Cancel whenever you want

## Best Practices

When tipping developers:

- **Be genuine** - Only tip if you truly appreciate the work
- **No expectations** - Tips shouldn't come with feature requests
- **Spread the love** - Support multiple creators if you can
- **Share their work** - Promotion is also valuable support

## Tax Considerations (AU)

In Australia, tips to developers are typically:
- Not tax-deductible for you (unless business expense)
- Considered income for the recipient
- Subject to GST if the developer is registered

Always consult a tax professional for your specific situation.

## Security Tips

- Only use platforms with secure payment processors (like Stripe)
- Never send payment to unusual payment methods
- Check the developer's official links
- Be wary of impersonators
