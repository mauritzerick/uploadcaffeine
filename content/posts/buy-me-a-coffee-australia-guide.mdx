Australian creators often run on caffeine and curiosity. Here's how to send one our way in seconds.

## The 3-Step Process

### 1. Choose an Amount

Pick from our preset options:
- **Small Coffee** ($3) - Perfect for a quick thanks
- **Medium Coffee** ($5) - The sweet spot for most supporters
- **Large Coffee** ($10) - For when you really loved what you saw

### 2. Pay Securely via Stripe

Your payment is processed through Stripe, one of the world's most trusted payment processors. We never see or store your card details.

### 3. Optional: Make it Monthly

Toggle the "Make it monthly" switch to provide ongoing support. You can cancel anytime through your Stripe dashboard.

## Why "Buy Me a Coffee"?

The concept is simple: instead of complex patronage tiers or reward systems, it's just a digital coffee. No commitments, no expectations—just a way to say "thanks for creating."

## Australian Focus

As an Australian indie developer, I built this with a local focus:
- Prices in AUD
- Australian business registration
- Local payment processing
- Time zone friendly support

## What Makes This Different?

Unlike generic donation platforms, this site has:
- 🌈 Cyberpunk neon aesthetic
- ⚡ Glitch effects and easter eggs
- 🎮 Interactive UI elements
- 🎯 No bloated features—just support

## Privacy & Security

- Payments via Stripe (PCI compliant)
- No spam or unwanted emails
- Minimal data collection
- Your privacy matters
